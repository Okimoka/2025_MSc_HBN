PHASE 1 (dataset creation):

sync_eye(link).py
-----------
- ((Implement more sophisticated "spike region" detection as described in the code))
	- Why this was chosen has to be explained in thesis, with demonstrative examples
- maybe change pyramid to proper pointy normal distr. or similar (then cutoff points on left+right might seen arbitrary)
- rename extra columns to the proper names (e.g. sacc amplitude etc. ) - use table headers from events file
	- check whether "Table Header for Fixations/Saccades/...:" differ across subjects/releases?
- Double-check that the 71 subjects that only have _Events are properly handled. Also check if some subjects are missing _Events but have _Samples. If not, always prefer _Events
- When implemented, integrate mne bad channel detection to fallback to different electrodes when default electrodes are bad
- MATLAB EYE-EEG tracked these metrics: median_fix_pos_left_x	median_fix_pos_left_y	median_fix_pos_right_x	median_fix_pos_right_y	median_fix_pos_avgLR_x	median_fix_pos_avgLR_y. maybe implement too?
- EYE-EEG also marks eeg regions where ET was out of calibration range. in the tutorial they stress how important this is (?), implement as annotations

Omitted (maybe explain in thesis why):
- Kullback Leibler divergence metric
- kolgorov smirnoff test with normal distribution
- custom saccade/fixation detection algorithm to compare with idt used in hbn


Before re-running pipeline:
- make sure it properly logs tsv/idf i.e. nonexistence of useful et files, rather than just skipping (et_data_format currently always txt)
	- every single subject should be listed on the overview, and whether it has eventsfile, samplesfile
	- Cross check with participants.tsv that at least all available subjects are listed
	- Check that subjects like NDARAB683CYD are there

score_subjects.py
-----------
- current quality metrics are not great. for each implemented quality check there should be undeniable reason for it to exist (!!!)
	- giving subjects better scores for higher snr / more shared events might be ok, but have some kind of visualization/statistic that shows why exactly


_config_utils.py
-----------
- made some changes on the cluster so it is more performant - is this really necessary? if yes, implement in a cleaner way


create_overview_from_derivs.py:
-------------------------------
- Finish legend descriptions for metrics, remove some useless ones 
	- Actually combine this with sync_eye, so we don't have huge pre-init object in there. Defaults could also be shown in the legend as a column in excel


Misc
-----------
- run "npx bids-validator ." on mergedDataset.
- double check that there are no unexpected files inside "Behavioral" folders from nitrc download
- properly setup github/julia (DrWatson, Manifest etc.). Note newest mne is needed also inside julia packages
- some subjects (e.g. NDARWU079DJZ from R11) have EEG only as .mat and .csv. Check how many - if it's worth, implement conversion to .set


PHASE 2 (Analysis):
-----------
- just work on uf.jl and clean it up
	- first get regular frps to look good consistently





-------------------------------------------------------------------
notes
- Why are some subjects in tsv? Can they still be salvaged somehow? (ask HBN-EEG corresponding author)
- when task_is_rest is set, config also needs rest_epochs_duration or else it crashes. what do i do? (ask jevri again)
- eeglab 3d electrode viewer is in (edit > channel locations > plot 3d)

- quickly mention why exactly specific heog+veog electrodes were chosen (langer paper has list of eog electrodes, and chosen ones were the ones on outer canthuses)
- include picture of typical eye movement for symbolsearch (gradient colored line with dots at samples) 
- ((Some subjects have super long blinks, but analysis of signals doesnt show this - maybe just mention that eye even detection is inherently inconsistent))
